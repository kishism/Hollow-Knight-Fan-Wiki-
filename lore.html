        The story of the Kingdom of Hallownest can be pieced together through
        dialogue, cutscenes, lore tablets, visual elements, and entries in the Hunter's
        Journal. While there are some ambiguous parts, in general, the information derived
        from these sources can provide a stable foundation for assembling the overall narrative.
        As long as all sources have been exhausted and taken into account, a player should,
        in their own right, have a general understanding of any lore topic.

      <p id="first">
          The Mantis Tribe is a tribe of proud and ferocious bugs whose traditions date back to ancient times before the kingdom of Hallownest was founded.These naturally-born fighters built the Mantis Village deep within the Fungal Wastes.Led by the Mantis Lords, they defend their territories from intruders with their lives.Their flying youths are compelled to prove their strength before becoming warriors.However, they all come to respect any who would defeat their leaders in honourable combat, and give them the freedom to enter their territory. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        Being opposed to the Kingdom of Hallownest,the Mantises negotiated a truce with them to retain sovereignty in their domain.In exchange, they agreed to keep the beasts of Deepnest, which borders Mantis Village, at bay.At some point, Elder Hu believed the Infection spread to their village and tried to purify it.He was killed by the Mantises after attacking them, not realizing his own madness driven by the Infection.

          The residents of the Hive, below the Kingdom's Edge, are a species of sentient bees. These airborne warriors possess a hive mind which dictates their behaviour among the Hive. Hivelings carry out simple tasks, and can colonise husks to serve the Hive's purpose. Soldiers and Guardians defend the Hive against intruders. Lastly, the flightless but fierce Lifeblood content Hive Knight acts as the last rampart before their monarch, Hive Queen Vespa, who grew so huge she could not leave the Hive. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        The Hive attacks any intruder who does not wield their blood. They also rejected the Pale King's attempt at perpetuation and separated themselves from the kingdom of Hallownest. Despite their isolation, Vespa's death weakened the Hive, allowing the Infection to spread through. The Infected residents never realised the death of their queen. Their corrupted hive mind dictated to defend her tirelessly, much to the sadness of their queen's spirit.

      <p id="first">
          The Flukes are a species of worm-like creatures who took over the Royal Waterways. They stay in the City's sewers for its calm and dampness and don't venture past it. Most of the Flukes encountered are Infected. Like other Infected creatures, they display violent behaviour towards intruders on their territory. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        Flukes are primitive, but not completely mindless. With the exception of the uninfected Godmaster content Fluke Hermit, they do not seem to have any other purpose other than to reproduce and grow. They also understand the concept of family. Their mother, Flukemarm, cannot move from her cave below the waterways and keeps breeding more and more Flukes. The Infection also made her noticeably angrier, enough to scare away the Godmaster content Fluke Hermit.

        Flukes usually wander the waterways looking for anything to eat. Godmaster content The Fluke Hermit, however, lives aside with some younger Flukes in the Godmaster content Junk Pit. She is also the only Fluke encountered by the Knight with whom they can communicate.

    <div class="text">
      <p id="first">
        The ancient civilisation was a civilisation of bugs that existed in the distant past before the Kingdom of Hallownest was founded.It originated from or near the Abyss but later expanded to the entire land of Hallownest. This civilisation did not devote its worship to any lord or power but instead worshipped the Void itself. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        Soul Totems are remnants of the ancient civilisation. These Totems are present in all areas of Hallownest and depict several unknown bugs or creatures. Soul Totems contain Soul, the substance that animates bugs' bodies, which can be used to cast Spells or to Focus. It is unclear what kind of power the ancient civilisation had over Soul.

Several Soul Totems can be found in Deepnest in the Sharp Shadow area. These Soul Totems have Void tendrils attached to them which appears to have corrupted them, forming the Sharp Shadow Charm. This Charm contains a forbidden Spell that transforms shadows into deadly weapons and bears a resemblance to the shape of one of the Soul Totems.

          The Dreamers are three beings who entered into an eternal sleep in order to use their power to seal away the Hollow Knight.The ones who became the Dreamers are Monomon the Teacher, Lurien the Watcher, and Herrah the Beast. Their seals are present on the exterior of the Black Egg located in the Temple of the Black Egg. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        The Knight encounters two projections of the Dreamers. The first time is in Greenpath after picking up the Mothwing Cloak. The second time is in the Resting Grounds after inspecting the Dreamers memorial. Both times the Dreamers tell the Knight to stop trying to break their Seals. In the Resting Grounds, the Dreamers attempt to prevent the Knight from finding their resting bodies by trapping the Knight in the Dream Realm.

After finding a Dreamer's physical body, using the Dream Nail on their body sends the Knight into a Dream that contains a vulnerable form of that Dreamer. Killing this form and absorbing it using Focus breaks their respective Seal.
