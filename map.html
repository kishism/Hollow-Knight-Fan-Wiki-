          Enjoying the bracing air? We're quite close to Hallownest's borders and those desolate plains that surround it...
                       ---Cornifer</p>
            <p id="second">The Howling Cliffs is a sparsely populated region in the northwest of Hallownest, separating the kingdom from a vast and unknown wasteland.</p>
                        <img src="assets/Howling_Cliffs_Map_Clean.png" alt="_" id="divider"><br>
                           <p id="first">A steep cliff bordering the wasteland outside the Pale King's domain, inhabited by small crawling and flying enemies. The ground is littered with husks and corpses of bugs.

In the northeast, near the chasm leading to King's Pass, Mato's Hut is located. The Cyclone Slash Nail Art can be learned there.

The Stag Nest is located in the northwest part of the area. It is only accessible via Stagways or by Nail-bouncing on a nearby Vengefly.

On the cliffside next to Cornifer, a dark cavern can be accessed. At its end is Joni's Repose where the Joni's Blessing Charm can be obtained.

Below Cornifer there are two breakable walls leading to a Lore Tablet and a passage where the Grimm Troupe content Nightmare Lantern can be found.

In the southwest, there is a chest that the Knight can jump into, which leads to a chamber with two Elder Baldurs. Defeating the one on the right leads to a room with the Baldur Shell Charm.</p>

            <p id="second">Dirtmouth, the Fading Town, is the first town on the way to Hallownest, located in the valley between the Howling Cliffs and Crystal Peak.[1] In Hollow Knight, it initially has only one resident, but more bugs can return or move into town depending on certain events.</p>
            <img src="assets/Dirtmouth_Map_Clean.png" alt="_" id="divider"><br>
                    <p id=first>
                        Dirtmouth is located right above the ruins of the kingdom of Hallownest, in a barren valley with rare tufts of grass, safe from the winds of the wasteland. Many lumafly lamposts are erected in and around town. Travellers used to come through the King's Pass, west of the valley, during the kingdom's heyday. However, a large door now bars access to the pass and the bridge leading down from it collapsed, forcing the occasional wanderers through hard detours around the cliffs.[2] The Knight reaches Dirtmouth through that pass after breaking down its stone door, marking the start of their journey through Hallownest.

Dirtmouth itself is almost abandoned, with many of the houses boarded up and empty. Elderbug is the oldest remaining bug in town and the only remaining resident.[3] Bretta and Sly, two of the missing residents, return to town if they are rescued, with Sly resuming his job as Dirtmouth's shopkeep.[4]


Town Centre
Besides a shop, Dirtmouth also has a Stag Station locked from the inside but reachable from any other Station. Iselda opens a map shop next to the station when a Map has been purchased or False Knight has been defeated.

East of town is a graveyard which leads to a stone door barring a cave, requiring a Simple Key to open. Confessor Jiji can be found in that cave in normal mode, or Steel Soul Jinn in Steel Soul Mode. Above the door, a lift goes up to Crystal Peak, but the lever to activate it is by the mines' entrances.

          <p id="second">Crystal Peak is a huge glittering mountain located east of Dirtmouth.[1][2] Mines were carved into the peak to obtain the area's precious crystals.[3]

                    <p id="second">
                        Crystal Peak contains extensive tunnels throughout the mountain which were used to mine its crystals. The crystals are present across the entire area, with some tunnels having crystals lining the top and bottom of the cavern. Conveyor belts can be found in many rooms which transport the crystal shards.


Conveyor belts transporting crystals
In the centre of Crystal Peak is a Bench with the Crystal Guardian boss. Its second form, Enraged Guardian, is located above this room, which can only be accessed once the Monarch Wings are obtained. A Mask Shard can be found after this boss fight.

A lift in the northwest part of Crystal Peak connects the area to Dirtmouth. On the summit of the mountain stands a statue of the Radiance which holds a Pale Ore. In the east part of the area are tunnels filled with old mining golems, one of which contains the Crystal Heart Ability.

Further below this room is a Snail Shaman temple where the Descending Dark Spell can be obtained. A nearby chasm leads to the Resting Grounds.

These features are deeply reflected in its inhabitants, who developed a natural mossy camouflage, allowing them to perfectly blend in with their surroundings.[2]


Acid Lake
Throughout all of Greenpath, pillars and egg-shaped stones with swirling carvings, sometimes reaching enormous sizes, can frequently be spotted.

Zote the Mighty can be found in the north part of the area being attacked by the Vengefly King. The Knight has the choice to either save him or leave him to die.

In the northwest part of Greenpath, to the left of the arena where Hornet is fought, the Lake of Unn can be found with a lone Moss Knight standing on the edge of the pier next to the shrine. Further west, on the other side of the lake, Unn can be encountered at the bottom of the lake.

In the southwest sector of the area, at the end of a challenging path full of thorns and Durandas, is Sheo's Hut, where the Knight can learn the Great Slash Nail Art.

In the very southeastern portion of the area, near the connection to Fog Canyon, the Stone Sanctuary can be found at the end of a dark passage below the Bench room. In the section above, lies the Hunter in his lair set up in a small cave.</p>

In the very southeastern portion of the area, near the connection to Fog Canyon, the Stone Sanctuary can be found at the end of a dark passage below the Bench room. In the section above, lies the Hunter in his lair set up in a small cave.</p>
